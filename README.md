# Overview

An introduction guide to Python beginners, especially for data analyst / data scientist Python users. This tutorial is for Python 3.6 version.

## Setup

There are different ways to install and run Python. The easiest way is to download Anaconda and run Python in Jupyter Notebook.

Step 1: Download Python 3.6 with Anaconda at https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos.

Step 2: Open terminal, type in `jupyter notebook`, then a tunnel for a web-based Jupyter Notebook App is established.

Step 3: Click the tap `New` on the top right corner to create a new notebook. Type in `print('Hello, Python!')` and `Shift-Enter` to run. If the string `Hello, Python!` is printed, then you should be good to go.

## About the repo

The notebook files (.pynb) with numbers are ordered introductory materials for Python beginners. It is recommended that one should start with `0-Notebook.ipynb` followed by `1-python-basics.ipynb` and so on. For those who have previous experience with Python, you can start wherever of your interest.

The __Udacity-CS101__ folder contains nontrivial solutions for problems in the MOOC [Introduction to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101). This course is a good starter point for people with no or little previous coding experience. It is taught all in Python.

The __Coursera-Course-1__ folder contains solutions for the Coursera course [Introduction to Data Science in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis/). It is the first of the five courses series in [Applied Data Science with Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python). I will upload solutions for the rest courses later.

The __Machine-Learning__ folder contains the classical machine learning examples and demos realized in Python. The __Demos__ subfolder contains examples on Python and PySpark data analysis on public available data on UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The __PySpark__ folder contains Spark related materials on cloud platform.

I will add more contents in the future depends on needs and mood.
